# 3D Sonic Mapping Python Program

This repository contains code and data for a novel sonic mapping method applied to coal samples. The method utilizes non-destructive sonic tests and CT scan imaging for validation, enabling detailed visualization of the internal structure of coal samples.

## Abstract

This study presents a novel sonic mapping method applied to coal samples, verified by CT scan imaging. Cubic coal samples with side lengths of 50-70 mm were subjected to non-destructive sonic tests, measuring both P-wave (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocities. Each of the three orthogonal directions (X, Y, and Z) of the cube was divided into 9 regions, resulting in 27 Vp and 27 Vs measurements per sample. From these data, 2D sonic maps were constructed for each direction, and interpolation was employed to refine the mappings. A 3D sonic map was then generated by averaging the 2D maps. The 3D sonic mapping results were compared and validated against high-resolution CT scan images, confirming the reliability of this approach for mapping the internal structure of coal samples.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to implement and validate a sonic mapping technique that constructs detailed 2D and 3D maps of coal samples. The method involves:
- **Sonic Testing:** Measuring P-wave (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocities across 27 regions per sample.
- **2D Mapping:** Constructing individual sonic maps along the X, Y, and Z directions.
- **3D Reconstruction:** Averaging the 2D maps to generate a comprehensive 3D sonic map.
- **Validation:** Comparing the sonic maps with high-resolution CT scan images to ensure accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Sonic Data Acquisition:** 
   - Each coal cube is divided into 9 regions per orthogonal direction.
   - Both Vp and Vs velocities are measured, yielding 27 readings per wave type per sample.

2. **2D Sonic Map Construction:**
   - Data is processed to form a 2D map for each direction (X, Y, and Z).
   - Interpolation techniques are applied to enhance the resolution and smooth the maps.

3. **3D Sonic Mapping:**
   - The three 2D maps are averaged to produce a final 3D sonic representation.
   - The resulting map is then validated against CT scan imaging data.
